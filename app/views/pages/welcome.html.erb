      <p>Welcome to Coding with Clair! I'm currently studying Ruby on Rails (with the aim of becoming a junior developer) and needed somewhere to store all of my notes! This website has: </p>
      <p><%= link_to "LEARNING GUIDES", snippets_path %> which contains plain english descriptions of bits of code I've picked up along the way</p>
      <p>A <%= link_to "JARGON BUSTER", entries_path %> which is a bit like a dictionary. I know Google has the answers to most things but have you ever tried to Google :&ampmap and got anything useful back? </p>
      <p>A <%= link_to "SCHEDULE", posts_path %> which tracks what I've been studying (and what I'm currently studying...in real time!) </p>
      <p>My <%= link_to "PORTFOLIO", page_path('portfolio') %> showcasing some of the projects I've been working on.</p>
