      <p>Since starting to learn to code, I've created 3 different apps. I find that, for me, the best way to learn is  by doing, so even though they are sample pretend apps, they've helped me to understand what I'm doing and put some of the things I've learned into practice</p>

			<p><strong>DISCLAIMER - </strong>I am no designer. I have no eye for design, knowing which colours go together or picking the best images. I figured this out right at the beginning and even now seem to far too long getting these sites to look passable. Please take the design of these sites with a pinch of salt and instead marvel at the functionality behind them. Life is too short to worry about margins and padding. </p>
