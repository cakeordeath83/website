    <p><strong>Elevator pitch:</strong> An app that stores all of the musicals you’ve seen along with the date that you saw it and the theatre you saw it in.</p>

    <p><strong>Client: </strong>My mum!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Features: </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Google map that shows where the theatre is located</li>
      <li>Google map created by taking Theatre name and City into account (no full address necessary)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    

    

    <p><strong>Further developments: </strong> Potentially searching, but we’ll see!</p>

<p>I’m so proud of this app. I worked out how to integrate Google Maps so that it shows the location of the theatre, uploaded images using Paperclip and pulled some nifty data from the models to display in cool ways (i.e. listing all the shows for that particular feature and sorting the index page by year). All in all it took 6 days (or 25 hours if you believe my Toggl account). But the thing I am most proud of is displaying the Google Map based on a combination of what was entered as the theatre name AND the city fields. I still don’t fully believe I managed to get it to work!
